# C++ Problem Solving

A growing collection of C++ problem-solving exercises focused on mastering core programming concepts through clean, reusable, and well-documented code.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **`Problems/`** ‚Äî Contains standalone `.cpp` files, each solving a specific problem.  
  Every file includes detailed inline comments explaining the logic and approach used.

##  Goal

To solidify my understanding of C++ fundamentals through hands-on practice and consistent documentation of logic, structure, and style.

##  Solution Philosophy

Each solution emphasizes:
- **Reusability** ‚Äî Common functionalities are abstracted into reusable functions to avoid redundancy.
- **Modularity** ‚Äî Code is split into clear, logical blocks that handle distinct tasks.
- **Maintainability** ‚Äî Clean structure and meaningful naming make the code easy to navigate and update.

This reuse-first approach leads to better structure, faster development, and more reliable debugging.

##  Coding Style

The code follows principles inspired by *Clean Code*:
-  **Readable**: Easy to follow without extra effort.
-  **Descriptive**: Functions and variables are clearly named.
-  **Simple**: Unnecessary complexity is avoided.
-  **Minimal Comments**: Comments are used where clarity is needed ‚Äî no redundancy.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Compile any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Example using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ Problems/Problem_001.cpp -o Problem_001
   ./Problem_001
