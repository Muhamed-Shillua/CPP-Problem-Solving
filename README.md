# C++ Problem Solving

A growing collection of problem-solving exercises written in C++.  
These exercises are designed to sharpen core programming concepts, logical thinking, and coding fluency.

## Folder Structure

- **`Problems/`**: Contains individual `.cpp` files, each solving a specific problem.  
  All relevant explanations, observations, and notes are now included as comments inside each problem file.

## Goal

To strengthen my fundamentals in C++ through consistent practice and detailed documentation within each problem.

## Coding Style

All solutions are written following the principles of **Clean Code** book.  
The focus is on:

- **Readability**: Writing code that is easy to understand for anyone who reads it.
- **Clarity**: Ensuring that every function and variable name is descriptive and meaningful.
- **Simplicity**: Keeping the code simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **Commenting**: Using comments wisely to explain complex logic or important parts of the code, but avoiding redundant or obvious comments.
