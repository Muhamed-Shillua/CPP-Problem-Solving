# Problems Notes

## Problem 1: Multiplication Table (1â€“10)
	- Used nested loops for rows and columns
	- Printed header in a separate function
	- Used another function to adjust spacing before each row
	- Can be improved by letting the user input the table range
	- No bugs or issues faced
---	
## Problem 2: Prime Numbers from 1 to N
	- Read a positive number from user using a loop  
	- Used an `enum` to define Prime and NotPrime states  
	- Checked primality by looping up to Number / 2  
	- Printed all prime numbers from 1 to N  
	- Function design was clean and modular  
	- Could be improved by optimizing the loop up to sqrt(N)
	- No bugs or confusion, logic was straightforward
